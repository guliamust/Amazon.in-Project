# Amazon.in Women's Fashion Sales Analytics Dashboard
## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data from Amazon India’s women’s fashion category during Q1 FY2023. Our goal was to clean and transform raw marketplace data into meaningful insights and business intelligence using Tableau dashboards. We focused on key performance drivers like regional sales performance, promotional effectiveness, fulfillment trends, and post-holiday return behavior to inform growth strategies.

- Which styles drive the most sales in specific regions?
- How do holidays and promotional periods influence shopping behavior?
- Where are returns, cancellations, or inventory mismatches hurting performance?

## Solution
We developed an interactive Tableau dashboard (backed by Python data processing and SQL querying) for intuitive, insight-driven decision making.

## Key Features:
- **Regional Sales Breakdown:** Identify best-selling styles, categories, and sizes per state.
- **Holiday & Promo Analysis:** Quantify holiday/promo-period impacts on conversion, AOV, and product trends.
- **Fulfillment Insights:** Detect spikes in returns, cancellations, and inventory mismatches, filtered by region and timeframe.
- **Executive Summary:** Actionable findings to inform inventory, promotion, and expansion strategies.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Data cleansing, enrichment, and analysis (Jupyter notebooks/scripts)
- **SQL**: Querying/aggregation from raw sales datasets
- **Tableau**: Visualization/dashboard for business stakeholders
- **PowerPoint**: Project summary report and recommendations
